      question: "What is SupplyMind and how does it work?",
      answer: "SupplyMind is India's first AI-powered anonymous marketplace specifically designed for street food vendors and raw material suppliers. Our platform uses computer vision technology to analyze vendor stall inventory, predict demand patterns, and connect vendors with quality suppliers through a one-way anonymity system that protects vendors while ensuring supplier transparency."
    },
    {
      category: 'vendors',
      question: "How does the anonymous protection system work for vendors?",
      answer: "Our revolutionary one-way anonymity system protects vulnerable street food vendors from discrimination and exploitation. Vendors can browse, negotiate, and purchase from suppliers without revealing their identity, location, or business details. However, all supplier information including credentials, quality ratings, and business verification are completely transparent to vendors."
    },
    {
      category: 'technology',
      question: "How does the AI Vision Scanner work?",
      answer: "Our proprietary computer vision system uses smartphone cameras to scan your street food stall and automatically analyze inventory levels of raw materials. The AI then predicts your demand patterns based on location data, weather forecasts, local events, and historical sales data to recommend optimal purchasing quantities and timing."
    },
    {
      category: 'suppliers',
      question: "What is the Surplus Buyback program?",
      answer: "Our zero-waste guarantee program ensures that any excess raw materials purchased through SupplyMind will be bought back at 60-70% of the original price. This eliminates financial risk for vendors, promotes environmental sustainability, and creates a circular economy model that benefits everyone in the supply chain."
    },
    {
      category: 'platform',
      question: "What types of raw materials can I find on SupplyMind?",
      answer: "SupplyMind connects street food vendors with suppliers of all essential raw materials including fresh vegetables, spices, cooking oils, packaging materials, disposable plates and cups, cleaning supplies, and specialty ingredients. Our AI system categorizes suppliers by cuisine type, quality ratings, delivery speed, and price competitiveness."
    },
    {
      category: 'vendors',
      question: "How much can I save using SupplyMind?",
      answer: "Street food vendors typically save 15-20% on their raw material costs through SupplyMind. Our AI-powered bulk ordering recommendations, direct supplier connections, and elimination of middlemen markup result in significant cost reductions. Additionally, the surplus buyback program provides an extra income stream for vendors."
    },
    {
      category: 'technology',
      question: "How accurate are the AI demand predictions?",
      answer: "Our AI system achieves 85-90% accuracy in demand prediction by analyzing multiple data points including weather patterns, local events, festival calendars, foot traffic data, and historical sales patterns. The system continuously learns from your specific stall performance to provide increasingly personalized recommendations."
    },
    {
      category: 'suppliers',
      question: "How do I become a verified supplier on SupplyMind?",
      answer: "Suppliers must complete our comprehensive verification process including business license validation, quality certifications, food safety compliance, and financial background checks. We prioritize suppliers who can guarantee consistent quality, timely delivery, and fair pricing. Once verified, suppliers gain access to our network of 10+ million street food vendors across India."
    },
    {
      category: 'platform',
      question: "Is there a minimum order requirement?",
      answer: "No minimum order requirements! SupplyMind is designed specifically for street food vendors of all sizes. Our AI system helps optimize order quantities based on your stall size, customer traffic, and storage capacity. For larger orders, we offer additional bulk discounts and coordinated delivery schedules."
    },
    {
      category: 'vendors',
      question: "How does delivery work and what are the costs?",
      answer: "SupplyMind partners with local logistics providers to ensure next-day delivery in major cities and 2-3 day delivery in smaller towns. Delivery costs are optimized through our AI route planning system. For orders above â‚¹500, delivery is free. We also offer consolidated delivery services where multiple vendors in the same area can share delivery costs."
    },
    {
      category: 'technology',
      question: "Do I need special equipment to use SupplyMind?",
      answer: "You only need a smartphone! Our mobile app works on any Android or iOS device. The AI Vision Scanner uses your phone's camera - no additional hardware required. The app works offline for basic functions and syncs when you have internet connectivity, making it perfect for street vendors with limited connectivity."
    },
    {
      category: 'platform',
      question: "How does pricing work on the platform?",
      answer: "SupplyMind uses dynamic pricing based on real-time market conditions, seasonal variations, and bulk ordering opportunities. Our AI system continuously monitors market prices to ensure vendors get the best deals. Prices are transparent with no hidden fees - you see the exact supplier price, delivery cost, and any applicable discounts before ordering."
    },
    {
      category: 'suppliers',
      question: "What are the benefits for suppliers joining SupplyMind?",
      answer: "Suppliers gain access to a verified network of 10+ million street food vendors, reduced customer acquisition costs, automated order processing, guaranteed payments, and data insights about market demand. Our platform handles customer service, dispute resolution, and provides marketing tools to help suppliers grow their business."
    },
    {
      category: 'vendors',
      question: "How does SupplyMind help during festival seasons or special events?",
      answer: "Our AI system automatically detects upcoming festivals, local events, and seasonal demand spikes in your area. It sends advance notifications with recommended inventory increases, suggests specialty items for specific festivals, and helps coordinate with suppliers for guaranteed availability during high-demand periods."
    },
    {
      category: 'platform',
      question: "What support is available if I have issues with orders?",
      answer: "SupplyMind offers 24/7 customer support through our mobile app chat, phone support in 12 regional languages, and dedicated relationship managers for high-volume vendors.
